# SwiftGDTF
A Swift library for interacting with GDTF files.

This library:
- Handles the decompression and parsing of GDTF Files, and their file resources (when using `loadFixtureModePackage`)
- Resolves node links present in attributes
  - This allows you to get all necessary data by just parsing a DMXMode
  - We cannot resolve the following nodes, they are currently represented as a String:
    - `modeMaster` in `ChannelFunction`
    - `mainAttribute` in `FixtureAttribute`
- Does not currenty parse Geometries (and geometry tags in other elements), Models, FTPresets, or Protocols nodes currently, if you would like to add support, submit a PR!
